    "## Assignment notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is split into two notebooks. `sequence_comparison_part_1` and `sequence_comparison_part_2`. In total, the assignment is worth 22%. While I have numbered those notebooks, you can do them in any order.\n",

    "## Differences to previous assignments and quizzes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 things about this assignment that are different from what you have done in the course thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is there is a question which you can answer \"by hand\". What this means is that if you don't feel you can write the python code, you can do the calculation in some other way. You are still required to enter the answer in a notebook cell and assign it to a variable whose name I state (so that must be valid python). For those who do feel able to write the python code, please do so!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is that there are optional \"extension questions\". These are harder (and marked harder) than the rest, but they earn you bonus points (stated in the body of those questions). These extra points are added to your mark FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT ONLY. The maximum mark you can score for this assignment is 22%, even if your total mark is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third difference is there are written answers. These are plain text cells where you will write your response to the question. Please be sure you have addressed them all before submitting! Please also be mindful of writing within limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers exceeding 50 words need to be formatted as per the logic assignment.** I am interested in logical answers where your reasoning is clear and justified by the data at hand or by reference to publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background material\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using data I have generated, or downloaded and processed to make it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data_description` notebook provides references to background on the transcription factors you will be analysing. It also describes a data set of gene expression measurements from cardiac stem cells that is included. Finally, it describes the origins of the sequence data that I've analysed to produce the log-odds scores you need."
